# OpenNitemare3D
a C++ engine reimplementation of the 1994 MS-DOS FPS shooter Nitemare 3D

## About:
I started this project because I believe every game has the right to be ported to modern operating systems,
the original game was made in C with some x86 assembly, this new version is in C++ and only uses open source, cross platform libraries,
so that it can be easily ported.

### libraries used(so far):
* SDL2
* OpenGL

checklist (Note: some of these are finished but not yet posted as I have to clean up everything before it's posted.)
* ~~~get original sprite files working with SDL2~~
* ~~Wolf3D style FPS controller~~
* ~~Wall collision~~ 
* Billboard sprites with collision
* Sprite rotation based on
