# OpenNitemare3D
a C++ engine reimplementation of the 1994 MS-DOS FPS shooter Nitemare 3D

### Note: this requires the original shareware Nitemare 3D game-files to work

## About:
I started this project because I believe every game has the right to be ported to modern operating systems,
the original game was made in C with some x86 assembly, this new version is in C++ and only uses open source, cross platform libraries,
so that it can be easily ported.

### libraries used(so far):
* SDL2
* tinyfiledialogs

## current goals:
- [x] get original sprite files working with SDL2

- [ ] Wolf3D style FPS controller

- [ ] Wall collision 

- [ ] Billboard sprites with collision.
